 # PagerDuty Solutions Consultant Challenge

PagerDuty (pronounced *pay+juh doo-tee*) is full-stack event intelligence and the end-to-end response orchestration platform. The PagerDuty service provides reliable incident notifications via email, push, SMS, and phone, as well as automatic escalations, on-call scheduling, and other functionality to help teams detect and fix infrastructure problems quickly.

Organizations taking advantage of the PagerDuty platform can visualize the health of services, infrastructure, and manage incident resolution all in one place. It provides actionable full-stack visibility and response orchestration to minimize cognitive load during alert investigation and identify the business impact of significant incidents.
